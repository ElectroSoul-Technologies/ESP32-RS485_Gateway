# ElectroSoul ESP32-RS485 Gateway
Industrial RS485 Gateway based on ESP32 is designed and developed by ElectroSoul Technologies. We had tested and used this RS485 Gateway with various slave devices for Monitoring such as MFM meters, Solar Inverters, AC Drives etc as well as for controlling AC drives, RS485-MCB or any other RS485 device.

We had tested our products not just in our lab environment but it has also been tested and is working right now in many harsh Industrial Environment.
